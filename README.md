# API Documentation

The dataset in json format succintly outlines the professional achievements that I have had 
over the years. The focus of the API was 'experiences' first and foremost because it seems to 
be the standard with the most priority of today's job market: needing experience to get experience. 
The GET methods allow for retrieval of the entirety of the resume and each individual experience. 
Now, this dataset isn't static; the CREATE method allows for additional experiences -- hopefully 
high-paying, glamorous ones. It was my intention to add a DELETE method to my setup; however, the 
question arose: why would I want to erase my past and not showcase my proud professional moments 
of my very young life. Were there technical difficulties to implementing a DELETE method? Ehh ... 
Let's not talk about it.

As for the representation of my beautiful code, Pug was a useful tool in streamlining this project 
and offering a better code-readability in comparison to using pure html. Upon clicking on methods,
the content-type header for each method is provided offering previews of responses.
